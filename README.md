# Dev Tools

Dev Tools is a Minecraft mod for Fabric 1.19.4 and higher, that has a few useful utilities for datapack creators. More utilities will keep being added as requests from them come in, or when I think of something useful! This will also eventually have integration with my other project [CMDB](http://cmdb.naomieow.xyz) ([source](https://github.com/naomieow/cmdb)).
